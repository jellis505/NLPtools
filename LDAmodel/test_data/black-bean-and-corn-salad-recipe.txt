4 ears corn, husks removed, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 3/4 cup diced red onion, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
 	 Preheat the grill to medium.  		  		Grill the corn until lightly charred, about 2 minutes, turning frequently. Transfer the corn to a cutting board and using a serrated knife remove the kernels. Set aside.  		  		In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil, then the red bell pepper and the red onion. Saute for 3 minutes, then add the vinegar, beans and corn and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic and the snow peas and saute for 1 minute more. Remove from the heat to a serving bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Serve warm or cold.
