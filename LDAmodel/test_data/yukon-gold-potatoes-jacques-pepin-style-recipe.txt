Salt, Freshly ground black pepper, 3 tablespoons butter
 	 Place the potatoes in a deep skillet and add salt and pepper, to taste. Cover potatoes halfway with chicken stock, about 3 cups, add the butter and cover skillet with a lid. Cook the potatoes in the stock until almost tender, about 5 to 8 minutes, depending upon the size of the potatoes.  Remove the lid and allow the stock to evaporate, about another 5 minutes.  Once the stock has evaporated pop each potato using a ladle or large spoon, creating a small crack in each, but do not smash.  Allow the potatoes to brown on each side, another 5 minutes, and re-season with salt and pepper, if necessary or desired.  Remove the browned potatoes from the skillet and place onto a serving platter, garnished with the parsley.
