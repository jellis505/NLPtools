Pile scallions lengthwise and julienne them into thin strips. Pull the threads from the ends of snow peas and julienne into thin strips, lengthwise, like the scallions.  		  		Drizzle honey into a small bowl. Add vinegar and combine with a fork.   		  		Place chicken cutlets on grill or into hot pan and cook 3 minutes on each side.   		  		Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil, 2 turns of the pan. Add pickled ginger and cut carrots and stir-fry 2 minutes. Add cabbage and stir-fry 2 minutes more.

Continue to toss the slaw and season it up with salt and pepper to your taste.    		  		Slice the chicken meat thinly on an angle.
