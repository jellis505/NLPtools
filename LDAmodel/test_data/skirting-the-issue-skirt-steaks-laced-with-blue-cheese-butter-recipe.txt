1 1/2 to 2 pounds skirt steaks , Steak seasoning blend (recommended: Montreal Seasoning by McCormick), 4 tablespoons butter, softened, 1/2 cup blue cheese crumbles , 2 tablespoons chopped chives
 	 Heat a grill pan over high heat. Drizzle meat with oil and season with steak or grill seasoning blend. Grill meat 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove meat and let it rest 5 minutes to allow juices to redistribute.   		  		Mix butter with cheese and chives.  		  		Slice meat very thin on a heavy angle. Place the meat on a plate and top with small scoops of blue cheese butter. Butter and cheese will melt down over the meat: YUMMO!
