 	 In a large bowl, combine yogurt with garlic, onion, vinegar, parsley, oregano, salt, cumin pepper, red chili flakes, and sage. Add chicken and marinate in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours. 		Preheat oven to 350 degrees F with oven rack in center. 		Fit a 9 by 13-inch baking sheet with a cooling rack. Remove chicken from marinade, taking off excess marinade. Place meat randomly on top of each other on the aluminum foil tray, creating 1-inch of meat. Add spinach, spreading evenly, and repeat with another 1-inch layer of meat. Add a layer of red bell peppers, and finish by covering with another inch of meat. 		Press layers firmly together. Remove foil tray with chicken to the baking sheet. Poke holes in bottom of foil to allow excess liquid to drain. Bake in center of oven 		for 45 minutes until chicken is firm and holds together. Cut corners of tray and push the sides of foil down, to expose meat to brown. Continue to cook for another 30 minutes or until the meat registers an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. using an instant-read thermometer. 		Let rest for 10 minutes. Remove Schawarma to a cutting board, discarding foil. Slice into 1/2-inch thick pieces. 		Serve sandwiched in flatbread and drizzled with Tzatziki Sauce.
