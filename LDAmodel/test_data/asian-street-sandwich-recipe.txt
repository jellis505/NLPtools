3 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 pound pork roast, sliced 1/8-inch thick, 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar, 1/4 cup mirin, 1/2 cucumber, cut in 1/2 lengthwise and thinly sliced, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 6 (6-inch) long sub rolls, split, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons hot sauce (recommended: Sriracha), 3 tablespoons oyster sauce
 	 In medium bowl, mix 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sugar, ginger, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce, chili garlic sauce, garlic, sesame oil and the pork slices. Transfer to a 1 gallon resealable plastic bag, remove all the air, seal and refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours. 		Heat the grill to high. Remove the pork from the marinade and arrange on the grill. Reserve the marinade. Grill for 5 minutes per side for medium doneness. Remove the pork from the grill to a platter. 		Pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and let reduce until it starts to thicken, about 10 minutes. Drizzle the pork with the reduced marinade. 		In a nonreactive bowl, preferably glass, add the rice wine vinegar, the remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar, mirin, the remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and mix until the sugar is dissolved. Add the cucumbers and let marinate for 10 to 15 minutes. 		Heat a large heavy saute pan over low heat. Drizzle olive oil on the cut sides of the rolls and arrange, cut side down, in the pan to toast. In a small mixing bowl, add the mayonnaise, hot sauce, oyster sauce and sesame oil, and mix to combine. Let sit for 5 minutes, then coat each side of the rolls with about 2 tablespoons. 		Arrange the meat on each roll, and top with lettuce, marinated cucumbers and cilantro sprigs. Slice in half and serve.
