2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni (an 8-ounce box isn't quite 2 cups), 4 tablespoons (1/2 stuck) butter, cut into pieces, 3 eggs, beaten, 1 (10 3/4-ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 cup whole milk, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
 	 Boil the macaroni in a 2 quart saucepan in plenty of water until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain. In a medium saucepan, mix butter and cheese. Stir until the cheese melts. In a slow cooker, combine cheese/butter mixture and add the eggs, sour cream, soup, salt, milk, mustard and pepper and stir well. Then add drained macaroni and stir again. Set the slow cooker on low setting and cook for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
