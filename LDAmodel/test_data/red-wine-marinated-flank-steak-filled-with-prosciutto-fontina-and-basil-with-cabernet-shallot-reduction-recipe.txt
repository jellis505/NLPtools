4 shallots, coarsely chopped, 1 cup dry red wine, such as Cabernet, 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 pounds flank steak, butterfiled, Salt and pepper, 1/4-pound thinly sliced prosciutto, 1/4-pound thinly sliced fontina cheese, 14 fresh basil leaves, Olive oil, Cabernet-Shallot Reduction, recipe follows
 	 Whisk together shallots, wine and olive oil in a large baking dish. Add the steak and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.  		  		Heat grill to high.  		  		Remove the steak from the marinade and blot with paper towels. Lay on a flat surface, cut side up, and season with salt and pepper. Cover the surface with the prosciutto slices, then top with the cheese and a layer of basil leaves. Starting with the side facing you, tightly roll up the steak around the filling. Using kitchen string, tie the roll in 4 or 5 places.  		  		Brush the outside of the steak with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the steak over high heat until browned all over, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the steak 4 times as it cooks. Move the meat away from the direct heat and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 125 degrees F for medium-rare. Remove from the grill and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Slice against the grain into 1/2-inch thick slices and drizzle with the Cabernet-Shallot Reduction.
