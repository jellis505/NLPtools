1/4 pound thick cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, 3 pounds pork butt, cut into 2-inch by 3-inch pieces, 2 teaspoons salt, 3 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper, 1 cup (1/4-inch) diced carrots, 1/2 cup (1/4-inch) diced celery, 1/4 cup roughly chopped garlic, 2 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/2 teaspoon dried sage, 4 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained, 1/4 cup sherry wine vinegar, for garnish
 	 In a cast iron Dutch oven, over medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook until just crisp. Remove from the pot and set aside on a paper towel lined plate. Season the pork and the chicken with salt and pepper. Add the pork pieces to the bacon fat and brown on all sides. Remove from pot and set aside on a large plate. Add the chicken thighs to the pan and brown evenly, then remove and add to the plate with the pork.  		  		Add the cipollini onions, carrots and celery into the pot and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes, then add in the stock, bay leaves, thyme and sage and combine well.  		  		Put the pork and chicken pieces into the sauce and cover. Reduce the heat and simmer until the meat is fork tender, about 2 hours. Add in the cannellini beans and cover and simmer for 25 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve hot with a drizzle of the sherry wine vinegar and a sprinkle of the parsley.
