2 cups parboiled long-grain rice, such as Uncle Ben's, 3 1/2 cups chicken stock, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 2 pounds small shrimp, peeled and deveined, 1/2 cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons), 1 tablespoon hot sauce, Freshly ground black pepper
 	 In a medium nonstick saucepan, heat 1/2 of the butter over medium-low heat. Add the rice and cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 6 to 7 minutes. Add the chicken stock and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer covered for 20 to 25 minutes until the rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed. Remove the pan from the heat and rest covered for 5 minutes. 		In a large skillet, melt the remaining butter over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 to 2 minutes until aromatic. Add the shrimp, lemon juice, and hot sauce. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the shrimp is pink and cooked through. Stir in the cream and heat through. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. 		Using a fork, fluff the rice and arrange on a platter. Spoon the shrimp cream sauce over the rice and serve.
