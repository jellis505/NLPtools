1/3 cup tequila, 1/2 cup fresh lime juice, 5 large egg yolks, plus 2 egg whites, 1 tablespoon sugar, Agave nectar or honey, for drizzling (optional)
 	 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Pulse the wafers and pine nuts in a food processor until well ground up. Add the butter and blend until evenly mixed. Set aside 1/4 cup of crumbs; press the rest evenly into a 9-by-13 baking pan. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool. 		In a medium bowl, thoroughly whisk together the tequila, lime juice, egg yolks and condensed milk. 		In another medium bowl, beat the egg whites and sugar with an electric mixer until they hold soft peaks. Gently fold the egg whites into the tequila mixture. Spread the filling evenly over the crust and bake for 25 minutes; cool. Sprinkle the reserved crumbs on top. Chill in the fridge for 2 hours or overnight before cutting. Drizzle with agave nectar, if desired. 		Photograph by James Baigrie
