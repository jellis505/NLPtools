1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 1 recipe Spicy Cherry Glaze, recipe follows, 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 cup diced red onion, 2 tablespoons minced garlic, 3 tablespoons hot sauce (recommended: Sriracha), 4 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
 	 Place ribs onto aluminum foil.  Brush the mustard onto the ribs. Mix dry ingredients thoroughly. Then cover the ribs with the rub. Let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.   		  		Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.   		  		Wrap the ribs, meat side down, in the aluminum foil then place onto a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 225 degrees F and cook for another 1 1/2 hours.  Then, open the foil and cook for 1 hour.  Remove ribs from oven, and discard the foil. Cut into 4-rib portions. Liberally slather on the Spicy Cherry Glaze, then place, bone side down, in a roasting pan. Pour the remaining sauce over the ribs and continue to cook for 1 1/2 hours, basting occasionally. When ribs are fork tender, place under broiler for 10 minutes to crisp the cherry glaze.  Serve immediately garnished with scallions and sesame seeds.
