4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, pounded thin, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 4 large eggs, beaten with 2 tablespoons water and seasoned with salt and pepper, Tomato Sauce, recipe follows, 1 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced, 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 (16-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, 1 small can tomato paste, 1 bay leaf, Salt and freshly ground pepper
 	 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 		Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge each breast in the flour and tap off excess, then dip in the egg and let excess drip off, then dredge on both sides in the bread crumbs. 		Divide the oil between 2 large saute pans and heat over high heat until almost smoking. Add 2 chicken breasts to each pan and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and top each breast with some tomato sauce, a few slices of the mozzarella, salt and pepper, and a tablespoon of Parmesan. Bake in the oven until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is melted, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven and garnish with basil or parsley leaves.
