1 cup fresh bread crumbs, 1 onion, diced, 1 egg, lightly beaten, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 2 (8-ounce) cans tomato sauce, 3 tablespoons vinegar, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/2 cup water, to thin sauce if necessary
 	 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  		  		Mix together the beef, bread crumbs, onion, egg, salt, pepper, and 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce. Form this mixture into a loaf and place it in a shallow pan. Stir together the remaining tomato sauce, vinegar, sugar, mustard, Worcestershire and the water (if too thick). Pour this sauce over the meatloaf. Bake for 1 hour, basting every 15 minutes with the pan juices.   		  		Cook's Note: Try serving as a sandwich with mayonnaise.
