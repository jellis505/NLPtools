Canola oil, for frying, 8 tablespoons cream cheese, 1 egg, 3 tablespoons milk, 10 thick egg roll skins, 1 cup raspberries, fresh preferred, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
 	 Heat 1-inch of canola oil in large saute pan, to 325 degrees F. 		In a bowl mix the cream cheese, ricotta, and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar with a whip, until thoroughly blended. 		Beat egg and milk together. Place 1 1/2 tablespoons of cheese mix in center back of egg roll skin and place 4 to 6 raspberries in the center of cheese mixture. 		Brush egg wash around edges of skin, fold left and right sides of skin in 1/2-inch, and then roll from back to front, insuring that the roll is sealed.
