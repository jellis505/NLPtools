1/2 cup salt, 2 quarts water, 1 tablespoon juniper berries, 1 tablespoon freshly chopped sage leaves, 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 4 or 5 cups water, 2 cups ice, 3 cups dry red wine, 1 cup sugar
 	 In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the salt, sugar and 2 cups water to a boil and simmer until salt and sugar dissolve. Remove pan from heat. Add juniper, sage and red pepper flakes. Let steep 5 minutes. Pour 4 to 5 cups water and 2 cups ice into the brine. When brine is chilled, submerge chops into mixture for at least 6 hours and up to overnight, refrigerated. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove pork from liquid and pat dry. Heat oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Cook pork until nicely caramelized about 6 minutes per side. Remove to oven to cook through completely, about 10 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before slicing. 		Serve with Red Wine Cranberry Glaze.
