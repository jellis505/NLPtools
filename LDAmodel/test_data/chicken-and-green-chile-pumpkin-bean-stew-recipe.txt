 	 Combine the chili powder, cumin, granulated garlic, cinnamon, salt and pepper in a small bowl and mix well. Sprinkle evenly over the chicken thighs and set aside.  		  		In a large Dutch oven (enameled cast iron preferred) over medium-high heat, add the oil. When hot, add the chicken thighs, not to crowd. Cook until nicely colored, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Repeat until all the chicken is golden brown. Remove to a plate to hold.  		  		Remove all but 3 to 4 tablespoons of the fat from the pan and, over medium-high heat, add the onions, Poblano peppers and red bell peppers. Cook until the onions are just starting to caramelize, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more, stirring frequently.  		  		Add the beans to the pot and stir to combine. Add the tomatoes, Green Chile Sauce and the pumpkin and combine well. Season with salt and pepper, and then return the chicken to the pot with any accumulated juices. Nestle the chicken into the sauce, cover and bring to a simmer, adjusting the heat as needed. Simmer for 30 minutes.
