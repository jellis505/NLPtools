 	 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 		In a medium bowl, sift together flour, soda, powder, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.  		In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar with a mixer. Mix in honey and vanilla until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, until fully incorporated. Mix in coconut, dried cranberries, oats and rosemary. Fold dry ingredients into butter mixture.
