3/4 pound ground chuck, 1/2 pound ground pork, 1 medium onion, chopped, 2 teaspoons beef bouillon granules, 2 teaspoons House seasoning, recipe follows, 1 cup cooked rice, 1/2 cup jarred cheese and salsa, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 cup hot water, 1 cup salt, 1/4 cup black pepper, 1/4 cup garlic powder
 	 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 		Start by cutting the peppers in half lengthwise, leaving the stems intact, and halving them also. Remove the seeds and ribs inside the peppers. 		Using a hot skillet, saute the ground beef, pork, onion, garlic, 1 teaspoon of bouillon granules, and house seasoning together. Saute until onions become translucent. Drain the fat off. Add the rice, cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, green onion tops, and soy sauce. Mix well and stuff the mixture into the peppers. In a small bowl, mix the hot water and the remaining bouillon granules. Pour this mixture into a shallow casserole large enough to hold all of the peppers. Place the stuffed peppers in the dish, cover with foil and bake for 25 to 35 minutes. Remove the foil and spoon the juice from bottom of the casserole over the top of the peppers. Bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.
