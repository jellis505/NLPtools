3 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 3/4 cup mayonnaise
 	 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.   		  		Place the sweet potato "fries" on a foil-lined baking sheet and toss with the olive oil. Bake until golden, about 45 minutes.   		  		Meanwhile combine the basil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. In another small bowl combine the mayonnaise, garlic, and lemon juice, and stir to combine.   		  		When the sweet potato fries come out of the oven, sprinkle with the basil salt. Serve with the garlic mayonnaise alongside for dipping.
