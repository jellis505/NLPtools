Butter, for greasing pan, 2 cups sugar, 3 eggs, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, 3 cups peeled and finely chopped apples, 1 cup shredded coconut, 1 cup chopped pecans, , 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
 	 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Generously grease a tube pan.  		  		For the cake: in a large bowl, combine the sugar, eggs, oil, orange juice, flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and vanilla extract; and mix well. Fold apples, coconut, and pecans into batter.  		  		Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a tester comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours.  		  		Shortly before the cake is done, make the sauce: Melt the butter in a large saucepan, stir in the sugar, buttermilk, and baking soda, and bring to a good rolling boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute. Pour the sauce over the hot cake in the pan as soon as you remove it from the oven. Let stand 1 hour, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.
