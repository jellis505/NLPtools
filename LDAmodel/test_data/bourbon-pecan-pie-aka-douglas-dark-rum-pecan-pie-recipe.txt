1/2 cup dark corn syrup, 3 large eggs, beaten, 1 1/2 to 2 cups pecan halves, 2 tablespoons good-quality bourbon
 	 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  		In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar and melted butter. Add the corn syrup, eggs, pecans, and bourbon, and stir until all ingredients are combined. Pour mixture into an unbaked pie shell, and place on a heavy-duty cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, and continue to bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until pie is set. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.
