1 cup confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons honey, 2 tablespoons milk, 1 cup lightly toasted chopped walnuts, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 cups sugar, 3 eggs
 	 Glaze: Add all the ingredients to a small bowl and stir until smooth. Set the bowl aside. 		Cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly grease a Bundt pan or tube pan. 		In a bowl, mix together the apples, walnuts, vanilla, and cinnamon. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. 		Using an electric mixer beat the sugar, oil, and eggs in a large bowl. Add in the dry ingredients and beat until completely combined. Fold in the apple mixture. 		Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes or until a tester inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. 		Allow the cake to fully cool in the pan, about 1 hour, and then turn it out onto a plate. 		Drizzle the apple cake with some of the honey glaze, serve and enjoy!
