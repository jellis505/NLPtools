 	 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. 		Rinse and pat dry the chicken breast, trim off any excess fat, and rub with 1 tablespoon of the Blackening Spice.  Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet over high heat, add the chicken and cook until brown and cooked through, about 6 minutes on each side. Remove to a cutting board, cool slightly and slice. Cover to keep warm. 		Heat the beans in a small pot over low heat until heated through and keep warm.  Prepare the remaining ingredients and have them ready for assembly. 		Heat a griddle or cast iron pan to high and toast the tortillas on both sides until crisp (if you try to fold them, they will crack). 		Lay out 1 tortilla on a cookie sheet and evenly spread it with half of the beans, 1/3 of the cheeses, 1/2 of the blackened chicken, 1 tablespoon of the green onions, and cover with a second tortilla. Repeat this layering order with the remaining ingredients. Finish with the third tortilla and garnish with the remaining cheese, cilantro and diced tomatoes.  Bake for 5 minutes.  Remove from the oven and portion with a slicing knife into 4 wedges. Serve with the Black Bean Salsa and Chipotle Ranch Dressing.
