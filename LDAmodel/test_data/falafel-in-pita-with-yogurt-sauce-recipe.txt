2 tablespoons canola oil, plus extra for frying, 1 medium yellow onion, chopped, 2 (14-ounce) cans chick peas, drained, 1 teaspoon red chili flakes, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon salt, 1/2 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper, 5 tablespoons flour, Pitas, for sandwich, Yogurt Dipping Sauce, recipe follows, 1 cup plain yogurt, 1/2 tablespoon lemon zest, 1 tablespoon freshly chopped cilantro leaves, 2 teaspoons freshly chopped parsley leaves, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, Kosher salt, as needed
 	 In medium skillet over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons oil and sweat onion and peppers 2 to 3 minutes then garlic and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.  		  		In a food processor, pulse together chick peas, red chili flakes, ground cumin, the egg, salt and black pepper to form a coarse consistency. Then add flour, parsley, and cilantro. Pulse until mixture starts pulling from the sides of the food processor.  		  		Remove mixture to a large bowl and mix in the onion mixture. Chill falafel until ready to cook.  		  		Roll falafel dough into 1-inch rounds. Then form rounds into an oblong quenelle shape, like a football.  		  		In a thick-bottomed skillet heat 1/2 inch of canola oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F. Cook falafel balls a few at a time, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Be sure to turn them so they do not burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt while still hot.  		  		Open the pita bread to make pockets. Place 3 to 4 falafels inside. Stuff with lettuce tomato and cucumbers and drizzle sauce generously on the inside. Serve immediately.
