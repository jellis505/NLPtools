2 tablespoons light brown sugar, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 4 tablespoons canola oil, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1 cup soy sauce, 4 cups water, 2 to 3-inch piece ginger, skin-on and sliced
 	 Honey-Mustard Glaze: 		Combine the vinegar and brown sugar in a small saucepan over high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved and mixture reduces slightly, about 5 minutes.   Remove from the heat and whisk in the honey and mustard and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Let cool to room temperature. 		Ribs: 		Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. 		Brush the pork racks on both sides with canola oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. 		In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the soy sauce, 4 cups of water and the ginger and bring to a boil.  Pour the mixture into the bottom of a roasting pan, fitted with a rack, and arrange the ribs on the rack. Wrap the pan with foil and roast until the ribs are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. 		Remove the ribs from the oven and transfer to baking sheets lined with foil or parchment paper.  Turn on the broiler and let heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Brush the ribs heavily on the top side with some of the glaze, put under the broiler and broil until golden brown and a crust has formed.  Remove from the oven to a cutting board and brush with more of the glaze.  Let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Arrange the ribs on a serving platter and serve.
