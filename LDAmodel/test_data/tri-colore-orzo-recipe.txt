1 pound orzo pasta, 2 cups fresh arugula (about 3 ounces), 12 fresh basil leaves, torn, 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 	 Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta and put the pasta on a large cookie sheet. Drizzle the pasta with 3 tablespoons olive oil, toss, spread out, and set aside to cool.  		  		Once the orzo is cool, transfer to a large serving bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and toss gently to combine. Serve.
