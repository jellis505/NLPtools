6 tablespoons butter, melted and slightly warm, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon , 2 whole eggs, 2 egg yolks, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree, 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, 1/2 teaspoon fine salt, 1/2 vanilla bean, split, seeds scraped and reserved, Bourbon-Maple Whipped Cream, 1 1/4 cups very cold heavy cream
 	 For the crust: 		Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 		Add all the ingredients for the crust to a food processor and pulse until combined; it should feel like wet sand, and just come together. 		Spread the mixture evenly into a 9-inch pie pan, using your finger tips or the flat bottom of a glass. Firmly press the mixture over the bottom and sides of the pan. 		Put the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the crust is light brown and firm to the touch, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. 		For the filling: 		Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.  		Whisk together the eggs, yolks and sugars in a large bowl.  Add the butter, pumpkin, cream, spices, salt and vanilla seeds and whisk to combine. Strain the mixture into a bowl.  		Pour the strained mixture into the baked pie crust and bake until almost set, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove and let come to room temperature.  Refrigerate until chilled, if preferred.  		Cook's Note: The filling makes more than what is needed to fill the pie shell. You are able to freeze the excess. We made a double batch and it filled 3 pie shells very comfortably. 		For the whipped cream: 		Combine the cream, vanilla seeds, syrup and bourbon in a large chilled bowl and whip until soft peaks form.  		Garnish each piece of pie with a dollop of the whipped cream before serving.
