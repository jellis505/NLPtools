1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 2 cups all-purpose flour, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 cup milk, 2 cups crushed butter crackers (recommended: Saltine), Drunken Pork Gravy, recipe follows, 1 pound ground pork, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon white pepper, 1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes, 1/2 cup diced onion, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1/3 cup white wine, 2 1/2 cups milk
 	 Cut the beef into 4 equal pieces. Put the pieces between plastic wrap and pound out, with the textured side of a meat mallet, to 1/4-inch thick.  Put the meat into a shallow glass or plastic dish, cover with the buttermilk, turning to coat.  Set aside while you prepare the dredging station.  		  		In a large baking dish, add the flour and season with salt and pepper, to taste. In a second dish, whisk eggs and milk together. In the third dish, combine the crushed crackers and the panko.  		  		Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Fit a baking sheet with a rack.  		  		Remove the steaks from the buttermilk, then dip each piece in the flour to coat, shaking off the excess flour. Next, coat them in the egg, then dip them in the cracker and panko mixture, lightly pressing the crumbs into the steak.  Set the steaks set aside to rest for 10 minutes.  		  		Heat the canola oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat.  When oil is shimmering, add the steaks, 1 at a time, and cook for 3 minutes on first side, 2 to 3 minutes on second side, or until cooked through. Repeat with remaining steaks.  As you finish, blot the excess oil on a paper towel, then transfer the steaks to a baking sheet, and keep warm in a low oven.  		  		Arrange the steaks on a serving platter and serve with Drunken Pork Gravy.
