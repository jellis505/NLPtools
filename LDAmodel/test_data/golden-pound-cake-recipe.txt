3 cups sugar, 6 eggs, room temperature, 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest, 3 cups cake flour, 1/2 cup buttermilk, 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, 1 cup Cranberry Citrus Glaze, recipe follows, 2 cups cranberries (fresh or frozen), 1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 lemon, zested and juiced
 	 In a stand mixer, fitted with the batter blade, cream the butter and the sugar for 8 minutes on medium speed, scraping down the sides often with a rubber spatula. Lower the speed to medium- low and add the eggs, 1 at a time, combining well after each addition. Add the vanilla and the orange and lemon zest.  		  		Add half of the flour, with the mixer off, then turn the mixer on low speed to combine. Add the buttermilk and cream and when well combined add the remaining flour. Continue to mix for an additional 3 minutes on medium-low speed.  		  		Butter and flour a tube pan. Pour the batter into the pan, tapping the pan on the counter a few times to eliminate air bubbles and put in a cold oven. Set the oven to 325 degrees F and after 45 minutes, carefully rotate the cake and continue to bake another 30 to 40 minutes. Check by inserting a wooden skewer into the center and when it comes out dry, remove the pan from the oven. The cake will fall a bit, but let it rest for 30 minutes. Run a sharp, thin knife around the edges of the pan and let rest for 10 minutes more.  		  		Invert the cake onto a parchment lined cooling rack.  		Cook's Note: Put a piece of parchment paper on top of the cake and pan, then flip gently over and allow to cool to room temperature.  		  		Dust with the confectioners' sugar, then slice and serve with Cranberry Citrus Glaze.
