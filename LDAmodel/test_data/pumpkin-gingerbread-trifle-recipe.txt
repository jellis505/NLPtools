2 (14-ounce) packages gingerbread mix, 1 (5.1-ounce) box cook-and-serve vanilla pudding mix, 1 (30-ounce) can pumpkin pie filling, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1/3 teaspoon ground cardamom or cinnamon, 1 (12-ounce) container frozen whipped topping, 1/2 cup gingersnaps, optional
 	 Bake the gingerbread according to the package directions; cool completely. Meanwhile, prepare the pudding and set aside to cool. Stir the pumpkin pie filling, sugar, and cardamom into the pudding. Crumble 1 batch of gingerbread into the bottom of a large, pretty bowl. Pour 1/2 of the pudding mixture over the gingerbread, then add a layer of whipped topping. Repeat with the remaining gingerbread, pudding, and whipped topping. Sprinkle of the top with crushed gingersnaps, if desired. Refrigerate overnight. Trifle can be layered in a punch bowl.
