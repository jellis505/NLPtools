1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 (28-ounce) can sliced peaches in heavy syrup, un-drained (use fresh peaches if available; see note*), Cinnamon, for sprinkling, optional
 	 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 		Put butter in a 13 by 9 by 2-inch baking dish and place in the oven to melt. Stir sugar and flour together and mix well. Slowly add milk and continue stirring to prevent the batter from lumping. 		Being careful not to burn yourself, remove hot baking dish containing melted butter from oven; pour batter directly over butter in baking dish. Do not stir. 		Spoon fruit on top of batter, then gently pour syrup on top. Do not stir. Sprinkle cinnamon on top of batter, if using. (The most important part of this dish is not stirring the mixture at this point in the recipe.) 		Bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Your batter will rise above your fruit, producing the most wonderful of crusts. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.
