1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, 2 garlic cloves, chopped, 2 tablespoons olive oil, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1 (4-pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces (giblets, neck and backbone reserved for another use), 1/2 cup low-salt chicken broth, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves
 	 Whisk the vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper in small bowl to blend. Combine the vinaigrette and chicken pieces in a large resealable plastic bag; seal the bag and toss to coat. Refrigerate, turning the chicken pieces occasionally, for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.  		Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove chicken from the bag and arrange the chicken pieces on a large greased baking dish. Roast until the chicken is just cooked through, about 1 hour. If your chicken browns too quickly, cover it with foil for the remaining cooking time. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Place the baking dish on a burner over medium-low heat. Whisk the chicken broth into the pan drippings, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the baking sheet with a wooden spoon and mixing them into the broth and pan drippings. Drizzle the pan drippings over the chicken. Sprinkle the lemon zest and parsley over the chicken, and serve.
