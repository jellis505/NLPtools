1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 onions, thinly sliced, 2 bunches Swiss chard, trimmed and chopped (about 14 cups), 3 garlic cloves, minced, 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can diced tomatoes with juices, 1/4 cup dry white wine, 1/4 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper flakes, Salt and pepper, 8 ounces whole-wheat spaghetti, 1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives, coarsely chopped, 2 tablespoons freshly grated Pecorino cheese, 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts
 	 Heat the oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the chard and saute until it wilts, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes with their juices, wine, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer until the tomatoes begin to break down and the chard is very tender, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season the chard mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper.  		  		Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring frequently, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the spaghetti. Add the spaghetti to the chard mixture and toss to combine.  		  		Transfer the pasta to serving bowls. Sprinkle the olives, cheese, and pine nuts and serve.

I chose a Barbera because I needed a wine to to stand up to the bitterness of the swiss chard and the strong taste of the pecorino cheese.  This wine's texture is smooth and the color is a dark ruby red.  Its bouquet is scorched earth and blackberries with a kiss of oak.  The pasta's flavors do not fight with the taste of the wine but is an explosion of flavor every time you take a bite of spaghetti or a sip of wine.
