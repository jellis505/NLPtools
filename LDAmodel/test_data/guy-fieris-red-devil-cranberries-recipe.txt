2 teaspoons canola oil, 1/4 cup minced shallot, 1/2 cup agave syrup, 1 blood orange, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, Kosher salt
 	 Heat the canola oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and serrano pepper and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes.  		  		Add the orange juice and agave syrup, bring to a simmer and add the cranberries. Cook at a low boil until the cranberries have all popped and are just starting to reduce, 6 to 7 minutes.  		  		Meanwhile, cut off the top and bottom of the blood orange. Working over a bowl, peel the orange with a sharp knife, then slice between the membranes, letting the segments fall into the bowl. Stir the orange segments and any juice, the chipotle and adobo sauce, cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon salt into the cranberries.  		  		Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick, about 20 minutes.  		  		Photograph by Andrew Mccaul
