2 cups plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 3/4 teaspoon baking soda, 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, 1 cup granulated sugar, 1/3 cup dark brown muscavado sugar, 1/3 cup light brown muscavado sugar, 2 large eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 1 (5-ounce) block semisweet chocolate, chopped into chunks (recommended: Callebaut), 1 (5-ounce) block milk chocolate, chopped into chunks (recommended: Callebaut)
 	 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silicon pads.  		  		Whisk together the flour, salt and baking soda in a large bowl.  		  		Place the butter in the bowl on an electric stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment and beat until smooth, about 1 minute.  Add the sugars and continue mixing, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes longer.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and the vanilla extract, beating until incorporated.  		  		Add half of the flour and mix until just incorporated.  Add the remaining flour, again mixing until just combined.  Remove the bowl from the stand and fold in the chocolate chunks.  		  		Using a small ice cream scoop, spoon the dough onto a baking sheet, leaving at least 2 inches between each cookie and bake on the middle rack until the cookies are lightly golden brown and still soft in the middle, about 11 minutes. Let cookies rest for 2 minutes on the baking sheet before removing them to a baking rack with a wide metal spatula.  Let the cookies cool on the baking rack for a few minutes before eating.  Repeat with remaining dough.
