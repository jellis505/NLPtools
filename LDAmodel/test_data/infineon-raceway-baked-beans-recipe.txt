Kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper, 4 to 6 slices thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, 1/4-inch diced (about 1 cup), 1 1/2 cups 1/4-inch diced red onion, 1/2 cup seeded and finely diced jalapenos (2 medium), 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 2 teaspoons fresh cracked black pepper, Apple cider vinegar, best quality, 1/3 cup molasses, 1/3 cup ketchup, Crusty bread, for serving
 	 Sprinkle the steak with salt and pepper. Set aside.  		  		In a large Dutch oven (preferably enameled cast iron) over medium-high heat, render the bacon until just starting to crisp, 6 to 7 minutes, stirring as needed. Remove 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat and set aside. Add the onions and jalapenos and cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes more. Add in the garlic cook 1 to 2 minutes. Remove all from the pot to a small bowl. Set aside.  		  		Wipe down the inside of the pot, add the reserved 1 tablespoon bacon fat and, when starting to smoke, add in 1/3 to 1/2 of the steak and cook, stirring as needed until just starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Remove to the vegetable bowl, repeat with the remaining steak.  		  		Once the steak is cooked, deglaze with 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar. Then return all the vegetables and cooked steak back to the pot and add in the beans, including the liquid in the can. Add the molasses, brown sugar, soy and ketchup, and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer over low heat, cover and cook for 2 hours, stirring every 20 to 30 minutes to assure that the bottom doesn't stick.  		  		Add in more apple cider vinegar, a few tablespoons at a time to personal taste, and serve with crusty bread.
