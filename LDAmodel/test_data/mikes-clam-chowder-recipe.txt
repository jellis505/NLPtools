5 cups clam juice, 5 slices bacon, 1/2-inch dice, 1 small yellow onion, diced, 3 bay leaves, 2 cups half and half
 	 Bring the clam juice and diced potatoes to a boil in a large soup pot. Cook until the potatoes are tender. Set aside. 		To make roux: In a pot, render the bacon, until crispy. Stir in the onion until it's translucent. Add bay leaves, thyme and butter and let it melt. Whisk in the flour and let the roux cook until it turns golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. 		Bring the clam juice and potato back to a boil. Whisk in a ladleful of clam juice into the roux then gradually whisk the roux into the soup pot until it thickens. Then whisk in the half and half and heat to a simmer while whisking. Add the clams and let simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Then add the parsley and kosher salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot with oyster crackers. 		A viewer, who may not be a professional cook, provided this recipe.
