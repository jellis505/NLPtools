1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1/4 cup sweet and sour sauce, 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger, 1 cup diced red onion, 1/2 cup peeled, diced carrot, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 3 eggs, beaten, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1/2 cup chopped green onion, 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
 	 Pork: In medium bowl, add soy and oyster sauce, ginger and garlic, and sesame oil. Add pork and let marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator. 		Heat grill to medium-high, and grill pork on both sides until done. Heat remaining marinade to 165 degrees F and use to baste meat as it cooks. When meat is almost cooked through, glaze both sides with sweet and sour sauce and let finish cooking while sauce caramelizes on meat. Remove from grill, allow to stand for 10 minutes, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. 		Rice: While pork is standing, heat oil in wok or large skillet on high heat until oil almost begins to smoke. Add ginger, as well as all vegetables except garlic. Cook for 3 minutes, or until vegetables are cooked, then add garlic. Before garlic browns, add rice and mix rapidly so rice does not stick to sides of wok or pan. 		Once entire mixture is thoroughly combined, pour beaten eggs over rice and vegetables, and toss again rapidly until all egg is cooked. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Mix thoroughly and then add pork. 		Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.
