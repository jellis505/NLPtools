1 pound angel hair pasta, 1/2 cup Chili Oil, recipe follows, 1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves, 1 lemon, juiced, 2 tablespoons lemon zest, Coarse sea salt, Dried crushed red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel, optional, 2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan, 2 cups olive oil, 4 teaspoons dried crushed red pepper flakes
 	 Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the angel hair pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.  		Stir the oil, parsley, lemon juice and lemon peel in a large serving bowl. Add the cooked pasta and toss with enough reserved pasta water, 1/4 cup at a time, to moisten. Season the pasta with salt and red pepper flakes, to taste. Sprinkle grated lemon peel over pasta for extra flavor and texture. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and serve.
