1 small zucchini, finely diced, Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, 1 large egg, lightly beaten, 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme, 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, 1 1/2 pounds ground turkey (90 percent lean), 1 cup panko (coarse Japanese breadcrumbs), 3/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
 	 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the zucchini, bell peppers, garlic paste and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper and cook until the vegetables are almost soft, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.  		Whisk the egg and fresh herbs in a large bowl. Add the turkey, panko, grated cheese, 1/2 cup ketchup, 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar and the cooled vegetables; mix until just combined.  		Gently press the mixture into a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes in a small bowl; brush the mixture over the entire loaf. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
