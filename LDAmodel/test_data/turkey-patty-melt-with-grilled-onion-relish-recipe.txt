1 1/2 pounds ground turkey, Olive oil, Salt and freshly ground pepper, 8 (1/4-inch thick) slices good quality rye bread, 8 (1/4-inch thick) slices Gruyere, Grilled Onion Relish, recipe follows
 	 Heat grill to high. Divide the ground turkey into 4 equal burgers, brush with oil, and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-well doneness (the burger will continue to cook when placed back on the grill in the next step).  		  		Place the bread on a flat surface. Top each slice with a slice of cheese and a few tablespoons of Grilled Onion Relish. Place a burger on top and then top the burger with the remaining 4 slices of bread. Brush the top of the bread with the oil and place the burgers carefully on the grill, oiled side down, and press down slightly on the sandwich with a metal spatula. Grill for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown, then brush the top slice of bread with oil, flip over, press the top with the spatula and cook until that side is golden brown and the cheese has melted. Cut in half and serve.
