6 large egg yolks, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup, Pumpkin Bread, toasted and cubed, recipe follows, Vanilla Bean Creme Anglaise, recipe follows, Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce, recipe follows, 1/2 teaspoon fine salt, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 8 ounces (scant 1 cup) canned unsweetened pumpkin puree, 2 large eggs, 2/3 cup water, 2 cups half-and-half, 1/2 vanilla bean, seeds scraped, 5 large egg yolks, 1/3 cup pure cane sugar, 1 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup apple juice, 4 whole cloves, 2 cinnamon sticks, 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/2 cup water
 	 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Combine the cream, milk, vanilla bean and seeds in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.  		  		Whisk together the yolks, sugar, maple syrup, and pumpkin puree in a large bowl.  Slowly whisk in the hot cream mixture until combined, remove the vanilla pod, and whisk in the bourbon. Strain the custard into a clean bowl.  		  		Scatter the pumpkin bread cubes in a buttered 9 by 13-inch baking glass baking dish. Pour the custard over the bread, pressing down on the bread to totally submerge it in the custard. Let sit for 15 minutes to allow the bread to soak up some of the custard.  		  		Place the pan in a larger roasting pan and pour hot tap water into the roasting pan until it comes half way up the sides of the glass dish. Bake until the sides are slightly puffed and the center jiggles slightly, about 1 hour.  		  		Remove from the oven and water bath and cool on a baking rack for at least 30 minutes before serving.  		  		Spoon some of the Vanilla Bean Creme Anglaise into a shallow bowl, top with some of the bread pudding and drizzle with the Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce. Top with freshly whipped cream. Bread pudding is best served warm.
