3 large carrots, cut into 1/2-inch dice, 2 large onions, cut into 1/2-inch dice, 5 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, 2 to 3 small poblano peppers, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, or more to taste, 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, minced, 3 cups diced (large pieces) grilled chicken, 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, or more to taste
 	 Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the carrots, onions, celery, garlic, poblano peppers, salt, white pepper, cumin, and thyme. Saute for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Stir in the chicken bouillon. Add the chicken broth and cilantro, and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Stir in the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until the chowder is thick and the chicken is heated through. Shortly before the chowder is done, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the flour and stir to combine. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes to cook the flour. Do not allow the mixture to brown! Ladle 1 cup of the hot liquid from the stockpot into the skillet, whisking constantly. 		When the first cup of liquid is incorporated, add another 2 cups of liquid, 1 at a time. Pour the mixture in the skillet into the stockpot, whisking to blend. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes longer, or until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the hot sauce, then the cream, and serve.
