1/4 pound bacon, chopped, 1/2 cup minced red onions, Salt and freshly ground black pepper , 2 pounds ground chuck, 80/20 mix, 4 kaiser rolls, split and toasted, 1/4 cup diced red onion, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh dill, Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 	 In a medium pan over medium to high heat, add bacon and onions, cook until the bacon is rendered but not crisp. Add the chorizo and cook until done. Remove the bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool. 		Divide ground chuck into 8 equal parts. Form into a loose ball, and create 4-inch patties. Layer 1 piece of cheese onto the center of 1 patty. Top with 1/4 bacon mixture, another slice of cheese, then add another patty on top and gently seal edges and form into a patty, about 4 inches wide and 1 1/2 inches high. Repeat with the remaining patties to make a total of 4 large patties. 		Heat a medium saute pan over medium heat. Place all 4 patties in the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on 1 side, then gently turn over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, cover and pop it in a 250 degree F oven for 10 minutes. 		Remove from oven, place onto rolls and serve with Worcestershire Tomato Ketchup.
