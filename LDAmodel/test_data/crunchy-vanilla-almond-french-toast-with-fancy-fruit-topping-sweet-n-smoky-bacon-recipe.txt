1 pounds applewood smoked bacon, , 8 large eggs, 1 cup half-and-half, 2 pinches salt, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, ground or freshly grated , 3 cups corn flakes, lightly crushed, 1/2 cup sliced almonds, lightly crushed, 4 tablespoons butter, , 2 tablespoons sugar
 	 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  		  		Arrange bacon on slotted broiler pan. Sprinkle with brown sugar and place in oven to bake until crisp, 20 to 22 minutes.  		  		Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.   		  		In a shallow dish, beat together with a wire whisk: eggs, half-and-half, vanilla, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon. In a second shallow dish combine flakes and nuts. Add 2 tablespoons butter to warm skillet. Place a cookie sheet lined with foil (for easy clean-up) near the stove. Coat 4 to 6 slices of bread in egg, depending on the size of your skillet, then coat bread in cornflakes and nuts. Cook slices 2 minutes on each side and transfer toast to cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining slices and transfer toast to oven. Bake 10 minutes, with already cooking bacon.   		  		While bacon and toast are in oven, combine fruit, sugar and liqueur in a serving bowl and reserve.   		  		Remove toast and bacon from oven. Warm syrup in a small pitcher in microwave 15 seconds on high. Serve toast and bacon on plates with optional garnish of mint and edible flowers.      		  		Pass syrup and topping at the table.
