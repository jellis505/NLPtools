1 round steak (approximately 1 1/2 pounds), see note, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, Salt and pepper, 1 medium onion, cut into strips, 1 medium bell pepper, cut into strips
 	 Cut steak into serving-size pieces. Season, to taste, with garlic powder and salt and pepper. Dust meat with flour. In heavy skillet, brown both sides of meat in vegetable oil. Transfer to Dutch oven. Combine garlic, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, and 1 tomato-can measure of water. Pour over steak and simmer over low heat until meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours adding water, if necessary to keep meat partially covered. Season, to taste, with additional salt and pepper. Hint: Cook this in a slow-cooker, according to manufacturers instructions, on low for a most fabulous dinner. Low heat on a slow cooker is about 200 degrees F and high heat on a slow cooker is about 300 degrees F.  		  		Note: to ensure tenderness, it is necessary to have the butcher run the round steak through a cuber.
