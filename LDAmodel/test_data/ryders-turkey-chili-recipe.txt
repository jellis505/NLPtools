4 tablespoons canola oil , 1 1/2 jalapeno peppers, minced (remove seeds for less heat), 2 small red onions, diced, 3 pounds coarsely ground turkey (thigh and breast meat) , 1/3 cup tomato paste, 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth , 1 tablespoon granulated onion, 2 teaspoons granulated garlic, 3 tablespoons chili powder, 2 tablespoons paprika, 1 tablespoon ground cumin, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 3 cups canned pinto beans with liquid, 3 cups canned kidney beans with liquid, 2 cups canned black beans with liquid, Saltine crackers, for serving
 	 Rehydrate the pasilla peppers in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes, or until softened; drain. Remove the stems and seeds; dice the peppers.  		  		Warm the oil in a large pot over high heat. Add the pasillas, bell peppers, jalapenos, garlic and onions and cook until caramelized, about 8 minutes. Add the turkey and gently stir, trying not to break up the meat too much; cook until the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.  		  		Add the tomato paste and sauce, stir for 4 minutes, then add the chicken broth. Add the granulated onion and garlic, chili powder, paprika, cumin, cayenne, 2 tablespoons salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Stir in the beans and their liquid, lower the heat and cook, uncovered, for at least 1 hour. Garnish with shredded cheddar and serve with saltines.  		  		Photograph by Hallie Burton
