1 tablespoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons sugar , 2 eggs, 2/3 cup milk , 1 lemon, zested and juiced, Butter, for griddle
 	 Preheat a nonstick griddle.  		  		Combine flour, baking powder, nutmeg, salt, and sugar in a small bowl. Whisk together the cheese, eggs, milk, lemon juice and zest in a large bowl. Whisk the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until just combined. Brush the hot griddle with butter. For each pancake, pour approximately 1/4 cup measure of the batter on the griddle and cook on both sides until light golden brown. Repeat until no batter remains.  		  		Empty the contents of the lemon curd into a small saucepan and warm over low heat. Alternatively, remove the lid and place in a microwave oven on 50 percent power for 2 minutes, stopping after 1 minute to stir the curd. Drizzle a few tablespoons of the curd over the pancakes, top with fresh raspberries, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
