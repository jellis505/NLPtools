3/4 cup finely diced red onion, 1/2 pound bacon,  1/4 inch diced, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese, Freshly cracked black pepper
 	 Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the onion and bacon and cook until the bacon is crispy. Remove the onion and bacon from the pan. Add the balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet and reduce for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.  		  		Brush the romaine with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place on the grill cut-side down and quickly sear until grill marks are visible. Set aside.  		  		For each serving, place a half head of romaine cut-side up on a plate and drizzle the balsamic dressing on top. Sprinkle with blue cheese and the bacon and onion, and garnish with cracked black pepper.  		  		Photograph by Yunhee Kim
