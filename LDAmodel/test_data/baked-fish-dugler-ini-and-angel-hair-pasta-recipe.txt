1 small onion, finely chopped, about 1/3 cup, 1 (15-ounce) can stewed tomatoes, Salt and pepper
 	 Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. 		To a small skillet preheated over medium heat, add extra-virgin olive oil, onion and garlic. Cook onions 5 minutes, until translucent. Add wine to the pan and reduce for 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and break up the sliced stewed tomatoes with a wooden spoon as they heat through. When the sauce comes to a boil (2 or 3 minutes) remove it from the heat and stir in the parsley. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Pour a few spoonfuls of sauce into the bottom of a shallow baking dish. Add fish to the dish in a single layer. Add remaining sauce and bake 15 to 17 minutes until fish is firm and opaque. 		Remove fish to serving plate or dinner plates. Spoon a few bits of tomato and sauce over the fish. To the remaining sauce in the baking dish add 2 tablespoons butter cut into small pieces. Add hot pasta to butter and sauce and turn pasta in dish to coat evenly and to allow pasta to absorb juices.  Pile pasta alongside fish and serve. If you are entertaining, try bundling portions of pasta around a large, 2-pronged meat fork, by twisting the fork in the pasta allowing it to curl up the fork. Shimmy the twisted pasta off the fork on to a plate you will create pasta "nests." This simple "twist" adds a lot to the plate presentation.
