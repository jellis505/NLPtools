1 cup plus 1/4 cup orange juice, divided, 1/2 cup plus 1/4 cup fresh lime juice, divided, 4 (1-inch-thick) bone-in pork chops, 1 tablespoon black pepper, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1/4 cup chopped red onion, 1/4 cup white wine, 1 Roma tomato, chopped, for garnish, 1/2 avocado, sliced, for garnish
 	 In a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag, combine 1 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup lime juice, and vinegar.  Add pork and let it sit and marinate for about 1 hour in refrigerator. 		In a small mixing bowl, combine all dried spices. Pat the pork chops dry with a paper towel and rub with the dry spice mixture. 		Heat oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Place the pork chops in the pan and sear on 1 side until brown. Flip over and turn the heat down to medium-low. Add onion and saute for 2 minutes. Then add the garlic and continue to cook until garlic begins to brown. Pour in the remaining 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup lime juice, and white wine. Simmer until the liquid is slightly reduced and begins to thicken. The chops should be cooked through. 		Remove the chops from pan and put on a warm plate. Continue to reduce juices in pan by half.  Pour over the chops and serve immediately. 		Garnish with watercress, tomatoes and avocado
