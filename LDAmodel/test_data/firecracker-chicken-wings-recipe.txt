5 pounds chicken wings, 1 cup honey, 1/3 cup chili-garlic sauce, 1/4 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup sweet soy sauce, 3 tablespoons Sriracha sauce, 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, 1/4 cup minced fresh ginger, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper, 1 tablespoon minced green onions, for garnish, 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted, for garnish
 	 Cut the chicken wings apart at the joints and discard the tips. Combine 6 cups water, 1/4 cup of the honey, 1/4 cup of the chili-garlic sauce and the salt in a large glass bowl. Stir until the salt is dissolved. Add the wings and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. 		To make the basting and dipping sauce, combine the remaining chili-garlic sauce, remaining honey, sweet soy sauce, Sriracha, low-sodium soy sauce, ginger and vinegar in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside half of the sauce for serving in order to avoid contamination. 		Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Drain the wings and sprinkle them with sea salt and pepper. Grill the wings until golden, 15 to 20 minutes, turning as needed. When the wings reach the right color, continue cooking over indirect heat until they're at the desired doneness, then baste them with the sauce, turning as needed until the wings are glossy and well coated. Garnish the wings with the green onions and sesame seeds and serve with the reserved dipping sauce.
