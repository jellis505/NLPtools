2 quarts cold water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 boneless turkey breast, 4 to 5 pounds, Spanish Spice Rub, recipe follows, Vegetable oil, 4 oranges, halved, Sour Orange Sauce, recipe follows, Flat-leaf parsley leaves, 2 tablespoons olive oil , 1 medium Spanish onion, chopped , 4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped , 2 cups fresh orange juice , 2 teaspoons grated orange zest , 1/4 cup fresh lime juice , 2 tablespoons honey, 4 cups homemade chicken stock , Salt and freshly ground black pepper , 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces , 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
 	 Place water in a large bowl or plastic container. Whisk in salt and sugar and let sit 5 minutes to dissolve. Add the turkey breast, cover, and let sit in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.   		  		Heat grill to medium-high. Remove turkey from the brining solution, rinse well under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the skin side of the turkey with the rub. Using tongs, dip paper towels into the oil and oil the grates of the grill. Place the turkey on the grill, rub side down and grill until slightly charred and a crust has formed, about 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat of the grill to medium, turn the turkey over and continue cooking, with the lid closed for 30 to 40 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the breast registers 155 degrees F (the temperature will continue to rise off the heat). Remove from the heat, loosely tent with foil and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Slice into 1/2-inch thick slices.   		  		While turkey is resting, brush the cut side of oranges with oil and place cut side down on the grill and grill until slightly charred. Ladle sour orange sauce onto a platter and top with the sliced turkey. Garnish with grilled oranges and parsley leaves.
