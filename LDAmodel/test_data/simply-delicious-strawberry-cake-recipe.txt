1 (18.25-ounce) box white cake mix, 1 (15-ounce) package frozen strawberries in syrup, thawed and pureed, 4 large eggs, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup butter, softened, 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1 (10-ounce) package frozen strawberries in syrup, thawed and pureed, 7 cups confectioners' sugar
 	 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease 2 (9-inch) round cake pans.  		In a large bowl, combine cake mix and gelatin. Add pureed strawberries, eggs, oil, and water; beat at medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth. Pour into prepared pans, and bake for 20 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.  		Let cool in pans for 10 minutes. Remove from pans, and cool completely on wire racks. 		For the frosting: 		In a large bowl, beat butter and cream cheese at medium speed with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in 1/4 cup of the strawberry puree and the strawberry extract. (The rest of the puree is leftover but can be used in smoothies or on ice cream for a delicious treat.) Gradually add confectioners' sugar, beating until smooth. 		Spread frosting in between layers and on top and sides of cake. Garnish with sliced fresh strawberries, if desired.
