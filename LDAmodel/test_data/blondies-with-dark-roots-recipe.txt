1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon fine salt, 1 cup packed light brown sugar, 1 large egg, 1/2 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts, 1/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut
 	 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mist an 8-inch-square glass baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. 		Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. 		Beat the butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with a mixer at medium speed until fluffy. Add the brown sugar and beat 3 to 4 more minutes. Beat in the vanilla and egg. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips, hazelnuts and coconut with a wooden spoon. 		Spread the batter in the prepared baking dish and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool 20 minutes in the dish before slicing.
