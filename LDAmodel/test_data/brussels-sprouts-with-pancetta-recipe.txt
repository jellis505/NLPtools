1 pound fresh Brussels sprouts, trimmed, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 3 ounces paper-thin slices pancetta, coarsely chopped, 2 garlic cloves, minced, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 3/4 cup low-salt chicken broth
 	 Partially cook the Brussels sprouts in a large pot of boiling salted water, about 4 minutes. Drain.  		Meanwhile, heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and saute until beginning to crisp, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until pale golden, about 2 minutes. Add the Brussels sprouts to the same skillet and saute until heated through and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the broth and simmer until the broth reduces just enough to coat the Brussels sprouts, about 3 minutes. Serve.
