1 pound rigatoni pasta, 3 cups purchased garlic-flavored croutons, (about 5 ounces), 1/4 cup slivered almonds (about 1 ounce), toasted
 	 Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta into a large bowl. 		Place the croutons and the almonds in a food processor. Pulse until it becomes the texture of bread crumbs. Add the crouton and almond mixture to the hot pasta. Add the peppers and the olive oil. Toss to combine and serve.
