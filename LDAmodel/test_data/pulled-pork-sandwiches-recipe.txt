1 (3 pound) boneless pork butt, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, BBQ Sauce, recipe follows, 8 to 12 soft buns with sesame seeds, Pickled Jalapenos, recipe follows, 1 jalapeno, finely diced, 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup honey, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, Salt, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon white peppercorns, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 3 jalapenos, sliced in half lengthwise, 7 sprigs fresh cilantro
 	 Preheat the grill to medium heat (the grill should maintain a constant temperature of 350 degrees F). Place a drip pan filled half-way with the chicken stock on the briquettes. Season the pork butt with salt and pepper and place on the grates of the grill over the drip pan. Close the cover of the grill and let the pork cook for 1 hour. Turn the pork over and continue grilling for 2 to 3 hours, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. More chicken stock may be needed to refill the drip pan during grilling. Remove the pork from the grill and let rest for 15 minutes. When it is cool enough to handle, shred the pork into strands with your fingers. Add the shredded pork to the BBQ Sauce and serve on sandwich buns with the Pickled Jalapenos.
