1 tablespoon seasoned salt (recommended: Lawry's)
 	 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 		Peel the skin off the sweet potatoes. Cut them in 3/4 by 1/4-inch wedges. 		Place the wedges on a baking sheet and toss with the oil. Spread out the wedges, making sure they don't overlap. Mix the rest of the ingredients and dust over the top of potatoes. 		Bake for 20 minutes, remove from oven, turn potatoes, and put back in oven and bake for another 15 minutes. 		Remove from oven, remove wedges from sheet tray, and let sit uncovered for 10 minutes. Then put back in oven for 3 minutes to reheat. Serve immediately.
