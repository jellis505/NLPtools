2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil , Salt and freshly ground black pepper , 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning , 2 to 3 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves chopped , 1/3 cup orange marmalade, 2 scallions, whites and greens, finely chopped , 4 cups baby arugula
 	 In a large pan, heat the extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high to high heat.  		  		Season the chicken liberally with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning. When the oil is hot and ripples, add the chicken and brown for 5 minutes, then turn and sprinkle with rosemary. Cook until the chicken is tender and cooked through, about 5 minutes more.  		  		In a small bowl, stir together the marmalade, vinegar and stock and pour over the chicken. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the sauce has thickened and becomes a thin glaze. Add the scallions during the last minute of cooking time. Arrange on a serving platter and serve topped with arugula greens.
