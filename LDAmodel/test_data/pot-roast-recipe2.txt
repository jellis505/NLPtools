1 teaspoon House Seasoning, recipe follows, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1 cup thinly sliced onion wedges, 2 bay leaves, 1/4 cup red wine, 3/4 cup water, 1 cup salt, 1/4 cup black pepper, 1/4 cup garlic powder
 	 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  		Add the House Seasoning, salt and pepper to a small bowl. Rub seasoning into the roast on both sides. Heat oil in a large skillet and brown the roast, searing it on both sides. Place the meat in a roaster pan. Add onions and garlic to skillet for 1 to 2 minutes to absorb leftover roast juice. Place into roaster pan with meat and bay leaves. 		Combine the mushroom soup, wine, Worcestershire sauce and beef bouillon into a bowl. Pour over the roast. Add water. 		Cover pan with foil and bake for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until tender. 		Remove and discard the bay leaves.  		*Cook's Note: If the gravy is not thick enough, remove the meat from the pan and pour the gravy into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and thicken it by adding 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water, stirring constantly.
