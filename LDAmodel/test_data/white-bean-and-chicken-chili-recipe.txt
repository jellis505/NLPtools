2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 large onion, chopped, 2 pounds ground chicken, 1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning, 2 tablespoons ground cumin, 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, 1 tablespoon dried oregano, 3 tablespoons flour, 2 (15-ounce cans) cannellini or other white beans, rinsed and drained, 11/2 cups frozen corn, thawed, 4 cups low-sodium chicken stock, Freshly ground black pepper for seasoning, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
 	 In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the ground chicken, 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, fennel seeds, oregano, and chili powder. Cook, stirring frequently, until the chicken is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Stir the flour into the chicken mixture. Add the beans, Swiss chard, corn, and chicken stock. Bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Simmer for 55-60 minutes until the liquid has reduced by about half and the chili has thickened. Add the red pepper flakes and simmer for another 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  		  		Ladle the chili into serving bowls. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.
