2 tablespoons butter, unsalted, 1 tablespoon canola oil, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, 1/4 cup white wine, 1 1/2 cups half-and-half, 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard, 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish, 2 cups grated Irish white Cheddar or extra-sharp white Cheddar, 3/4 cup fresh peas, or frozen, 1 pound cooked linguini
 	 In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add the butter and 1 tablespoon canola oil. Add the carrots and cabbage and saute until they are just tender and the cabbage is starting to caramelize, about 20 minutes.  Stir in the shallots and garlic and saute 3 to 4 minutes longer. Add the corned beef and black pepper and cook until the beef is starting to crisp, about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally during this process. Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Add in the cream, half- and-half, the mustards and the horseradish. Let simmer until the sauce has tightened up a bit, about 5 minutes. Stir in the shredded cheese and adjust seasonings, as needed. Stir in the peas and the pasta, then transfer into a serving dish. Serve immediately garnished with the Parmesan.
