2 teaspoons House Seasoning, recipe follows, divided, 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt, 6 pork chops, 1 cup buttermilk, 1 cup salt, 1/4 cup black pepper
 	 Heat oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot to 350 degrees F. 		Sprinkle the seasonings on both sides of the pork chops, rubbing them thoroughly into the meat. Pour buttermilk over meat and turn to coat on all sides. Season flour generously with House Seasoning, roll each chop into flour, and shake off the excess. Carefully place the chops, 2 at a time, into the hot oil, and cook until the outside is golden brown. Take 1 chop out and make a small cut at the thickest part to check for doneness; adjust time accordingly for the rest. Drain on paper towels before serving.
