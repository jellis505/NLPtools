1 1/2 pounds ground chuck, 1 onion, 2 teaspoons ground oregano, 1 teaspoon ground basil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano, 1 1/2 cups small curd cottage cheese, 1 (5-ounce) package grated Parmigianno-Reggiano, 2 large eggs, lightly beaten, 9 oven-ready lasagna noodles, 2 (8-ounce) packages shredded mozzarella
 	 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  		  		In a large saucepan, combine ground chuck, sausage onion and garlic. Cook over medium heat until meat is browned and crumbled; drain.  		  		Return meat to pan and add oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Add tomatoes, tomato sauce and paste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 to 45 minutes.  		  		In a small bowl, combine cottage cheese, Parmesan, parsley, and eggs.  		  		Spoon 1/4 of sauce into bottom of a 13 by 9 by 2-inch baking pan. Place 3 uncooked lasagna noodles on top of sauce. Do not overlap noodles. Spread 1/3 of cottage cheese mixture over noodles, top with 1/4 of sauce and 1/3 mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers, ending with sauce, reserving 1/3 of mozzarella cheese.  		  		Bake 45 minutes. Top with remaining cheese and bake 15 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.
