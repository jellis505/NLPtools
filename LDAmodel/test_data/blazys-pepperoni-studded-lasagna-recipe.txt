Salt , 1 pound lasagna sheets , 8 ounces sliced pepperoni (about 2 cups) , 4 cups Tomato Sauce, recipe follows , 1 pound ricotta , 1 pound shredded mozzarella , 2 pounds bulk Italian sausage, cooked , 3/4 cup grated Parmesan, 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil , 1 yellow onion, diced , 5 medium cloves garlic, minced , Two 28-ounce cans crushed tomatoes , 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil , 1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano , Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 	 Preheat the oven to 375degrees F. 		Boil 6 quarts of water, add a pinch of salt and cook the pasta to almost done, about 7 minutes. Remove from the water and shock in an ice bath. 		In a medium saucepan, add the pepperoni and saute over medium heat until crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. 		In a 10- by 14- by 3-inch baking pan or dish, pour 1 cup of the Tomato Sauce in the bottom and around the sides. Layer lasagna sheets on the bottom of the pan, overlapping by 1/2 inch. Add one-third of the ricotta and one-quarter of the mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni and Parmesan. Spoon 1 cup of tomato sauce over the top. Repeat this two more times. 		On the top sheet, finish with the remaining cup of tomato sauce, mozzarella, sausage and pepperoni and dust with Parmesan. Bake until the cheese bubbles around the edges and the top is melted and light golden brown, about 45 minutes. If baking the dish from the freezer, add 15 to 20 minutes to the cook time, or until it's bubbly. Cover loosely with foil if it's browning too quickly. Remove from the oven; let sit for 15 minutes. Cut and serve immediately with more sauce, if desired.
