2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cups Israeli couscous (or barley or orzo), 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves, 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves, 1 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted, see Cook's Note, , 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 cup olive oil
 	 For the couscous: In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the couscous and cook, stirring occasionally until slightly browned and aromatic, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10 to12 minutes or until the liquid has evaporated. Transfer the cooked couscous to a large bowl and set aside to cool. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, apple, dried cranberries, and almonds.  		  		For the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, maple syrup, salt, and pepper. Whisk in the olive oil until smooth. Pour the vinaigrette over the couscous and toss to coat evenly.  		  		Cook's Note: To toast the almonds, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Cool completely before using.
