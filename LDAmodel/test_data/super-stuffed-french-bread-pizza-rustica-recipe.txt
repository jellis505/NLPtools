 	 Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. 		Split bread lengthwise and hollow it out. Cut in half across, making 4 shells for pizzas. 		Heat a skillet over medium high flame and brown sausage in extra-virgin olive oil. Brown and crumble sausage. Add red bell pepper, onion and garlic. Cook 3 to 5 minutes, add spinach. Remove mixture from heat and season with a pinch of salt and black pepper, to your taste. 		Transfer to a bowl. Combine sausage and veggies with ricotta, Parmesan, sopressata and pepperoni. Fill bread shells and top with mounded mozzarella and provolone cheeses. Place in hot oven on cookie sheet and bake until cheese melts and bubbles and bread is super crisp, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Top pizzas with oregano and hot pepper flakes. Serve immediately, or snack all night!
