Salt, 1 pound farfalle pasta, 3 tablespoons butter, 1 pound cremini mushrooms, thickly sliced, 1 pound thin asparagus, trimmed, cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces, 1 cup mascarpone cheese, Pinch freshly grated nutmeg, 3/4 cup walnuts, toasted, 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
 	 Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the farfalle and cook until al dente, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.  		  		Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and saute until tender and most of the juices have evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add the asparagus and saute until the asparagus is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add the farfalle. Stir in the mascarpone and nutmeg and toss until the cheese coats the pasta, adding the reserved cooking liquid 1/4 cup at a time to moisten. Stir in 1/2 cup of walnuts. Season the pasta, to taste, with salt and pepper. Mound the pasta in a large bowl. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and remaining 1/4 cup of walnuts. Serve.
