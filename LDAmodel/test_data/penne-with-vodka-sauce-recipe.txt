1 quart Simple Tomato Sauce, recipe follows, or store-bought marinara sauce, blended until smooth, 1 cup vodka, 1/2 cup heavy cream, at room temperature, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, 1 pound penne
 	 Simmer the tomato sauce and vodka in a heavy large skillet over low heat until the mixture reduces by 1/4, stirring often, about 20 minutes. Stir the cream into the tomato and vodka sauce. Simmer over low heat until the sauce is heated through. Stir in the Parmesan cheese until melted and well blended. 		Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Drain the pasta and transfer it to the pan with the sauce, and toss to coat.
