4 large onions, thinly sliced (about 3 pounds), 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, , 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 4 to 6 pork chops
 	 For the onion marmellata, place a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and the onions. Stir to combine and cook until starting to sizzle, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients. Reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and cook over low heat for 2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes to scrape up any brown bits. The onions should be a soft, jam-like consistency and a deep mahogany color.  		  		Meanwhile, for the pork chops, combine the rosemary, thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Using your fingers, work all the ingredients together until well combined. Rub the herb mixture over the pork chops. Cover with plastic wrap and reserve in the refrigerator.  		  		About 20 minutes before the onions are finished, remove the pork chops from the refrigerator. Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Grill the pork chops to medium, about 7 minutes a side depending on thickness. To serve, spoon the onion marmellata over the pork chops. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley. Serve immediately.
