2 red peppers, cored and cut into 1-inch wide strips, 2 zucchini, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1-inch cubes, 2 summer squash, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1-inch cubes, 4 cremini mushrooms, halved, 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced into 1-inch strips, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, divided, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided, 1 tablespoon dried Italian herb mix or herbs de Provence, 1 pound penne pasta, 3 cups marinara sauce (store bought or homemade), 1 cup grated fontina cheese, 1/2 cup grated smoked mozzarella, 1 1/2 cups frozen peas, thawed, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus 1/3 cup for topping, 2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
 	 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.  		  		On a baking sheet, toss the peppers, zucchini, squash, mushrooms, and onions with olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and dried herbs. Roast until tender, about 15 minutes.  		  		Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook for about 6 minutes. Since you will be cooking the pasta a second time in the oven, you want to make sure the inside is still hard. Drain in a colander.  		  		In a large bowl, toss the drained pasta with the roasted vegetables, marinara sauce, cheeses, peas, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Using a wooden spoon, gently mix, until all the pasta is coated with the sauce and the ingredients are combined.  		  		Pour the pasta into a greased 9 by 13-inch pan. Top with the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan and butter pieces. Bake until top is golden and cheese melts, about 25 minutes.
