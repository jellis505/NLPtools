1 onion, finely diced, 2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 2 1/2 teaspoons ground cloves, 2 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin, 2 1/2 teaspoons powdered ginger, 2 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard, 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 4 cups low-sodium beef stock, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 1 pound bucatini noodles, boiled in salted water, drained
 	 In a large saute pan over medium heat, brown the ground beef while breaking the mass into smaller pieces. While the meat is cooking and still a little pink, add the onion and saute until the beef is fully cooked and the onion turns translucent.  Drain all of the fat from the pan. Add all the dry spices and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, then stir in the tomato sauce. Once combined, incorporate the beef stock, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 hour. Put the cooked bucatini in a serving bowl and add the meat sauce. Garnish with Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve.
