1 1/2 pounds small new red potatoes (about 15), scrubbed and dried
 	 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 		Pare a narrow strip of peel from the middle of each potato. In a large bowl mix the oil, garlic, and rosemary; add the potatoes and toss well. Transfer the potatoes to a shallow baking pan and roast until potatoes are tender when tested with the tip of a knife. Serve hot. These can also be chilled and served with fried chicken or ham.
