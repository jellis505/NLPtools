2 sticks cold butter, cut into cubes, 5 tablespoons cold lard, cut into cubes, 2/3 cup ice water, 6 jalapenos, roasted and seeded (do not remove blistered skin), 1 1/2 cups tightly packed cilantro leaves, Extra-virgin olive oil, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 cup finely grated Cotija cheese, 2 to 3 green onions, (dark and pale green part) thinly sliced, 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves, 10 large eggs, 1 3/4 cups milk, 4 ounces soft goat cheese, frozen for 10 minutes and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
 	 Combine the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times. Scatter the butter and lard over the top of the flour and pulse until the mixture forms large crumbs.  Add the water, a few tablespoons at a time, and pulse until the dough just comes together.  Divide into 2 equal pieces, flatten each half into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until chilled through, at least 1 hour.  		On a lightly floured work surface, roll 1 of the disks into a 16-inch round. (Reserve the other disk for another purpose. It will keep in the freezer, double wrapped in plastic wrap then single wrapped in foil for up to 4 months.) Fit the dough into a 2-inch deep-dish tart pan with a removable bottom, gently pressing it into the sides. Using a sharp knife, trim the dough evenly with the edge of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap; and chill until firm, about 20 minutes. 		Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  		Put the tart pan on a baking sheet, line the dough with parchment and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove the weights and paper and continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Let cool slightly (not all the way) on a baking rack.  		Put the jalapenos, cilantro, garlic, pine nuts and oil in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse until the mixture has a pesto-like consistency; you want a bit of texture. Add the cheese and salt and pepper, to taste, and pulse a few times to distribute the cheese.  		Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  		Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer.  Add the chorizo and cook until golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Let cool slightly.  		Scatter the fontina, Cotija, green onions, chorizo and thyme over the warm tart shell.  Whisk the eggs in a large bowl.  Add the milk and cream and whisk until smooth.  Pour into the shell and evenly distribute the goat cheese over the top.  Bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the center is almost set (still slightly jiggles) but the sides are set, about 40 to 50 minutes. Let sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before serving. Cut into wedges and drizzle jalapeno pesto over the top.
