1/2 cup cashews, 1/2 cup grated Asiago, Salt, 3 pounds country sausage, 2 cups shredded mozzarella, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 2 teaspoons granulated garlic, 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, 6 Roma tomatoes, diced, 1 cup grated Asiago, 3 tablespoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 cups milk, 1 stick butter, softened
 	 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 		To make the pesto: Place all the ingredients in a food processor and process until mixture turns into a smooth paste. Set aside. 		To make the filling: In a saute pan over medium heat, add oil and then the sausage. Saute the sausage, breaking it up with a spoon, until it cooks through and it turns golden brown. Cool slightly and drain the fat. Set sausage aside in a bowl. Keep mozzarella and Asiago cheese on standby. 		To make the topping: Heat a large saute pan with oil, add the peppers, onion, granulated garlic and Italian seasoning. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and mushrooms and cook another 5 minutes. Don't overcook the tomatoes. They should retain their shape. Set aside. 		To make the biscuit dough: In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the butter and with your fingertips or with a pastry blender blend together until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in milk, using a fork, until the dough comes together. Sprinkle flour on a clean work surface, remove the dough from the bowl and knead several times on the floured surface. Add small amounts of flour, as needed, so that dough will be easy to roll out. Roll the dough out to roughly 15-inches in diameter. 		To assemble: Sprinkle the top of the dough evenly with the sausage and top with the mozzarella and Asiago. Roll the dough into a log. Cut the ends off to create even edges then cut the log into 7 or 8 pieces, depending on the length of the roll. Place slices on a baking sheet and press the tops down. Put the ends on the baking sheet and press those tops down. Bake 20 to 30 minutes until biscuits turn golden. Transfer the rolls to a serving platter. Serve topped with the sauteed vegetables and sprinkled with remaining cheese. 		This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant.
